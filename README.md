Just some fun with Castle Game Engine
http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/ and level designed from
tower assets from http://opengameart.org/ (see data/levels/tower/AUTHORS.txt
for details).

You will need Castle Game Engine and FPC (Free Pascal Compiler)
to compile. You will need Blender http://www.blender.org/ to edit 3D data.

Feel free to extend this and have a little fun yourself :)
See Castle Game Engine documentation and tutorial
http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/tutorial_intro.php ,
in particular see castle_game_engine/examples/fps_game/ ,
for information how to easily make 3D games using Castle Game Engine.
